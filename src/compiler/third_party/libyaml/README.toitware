Description:
A Yaml library for C.

We have patched the CMakeLists.txt to avoid warnings during build.
See 'toitware.diff' for the changes, and https://github.com/yaml/libyaml/issues/210.

We have patched the CMakeLists.txt to increase the minimum CMake version, as
newer versions of CMake warn otherwise.
See 'toitware2.diff' for the changes.

Similarly, we have changed the .gitignore file, so it doesn't exclude the
config.h.in file in the 'cmake' directory.
See https://github.com/yaml/libyaml/pull/232 for a pull request to the project.
