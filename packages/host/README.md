# Host

Host libraries for the Toit platform.

These libraries don't run on the ESP32 and are only useful on desktop machines.

## Installation

This package is not yet published on pkg.toit.io. As such it is best to
simply install it as a local package:

```
toitpkg pkg install --name=host --local <PATH_TO_HOST_PACKAGE>
```

where `<PATH_TO_HOST_PACKAGE>` is the folder containing this README.
