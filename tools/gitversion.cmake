# Computes a version from git branches and git tags.
# If a commit is tagged explicitly with a version tag (v1.2.3) then use that one.
# If a commit is on a release-branch (release-v1.2), then we have two cases:
#   - there is already a release on this branch (visible by a version tag with the
#     same major/minor)
#   - there isn't a release yet.
# If there is already a release, then count the commits since that release, and
#   mark the current commit as a prerelease of a patch-release. For example,
#   if we are on release-v1.2 and there is a tag v1.2.4. Then we count the commits
#   since that tag (say 5) and return 'v1.2.5-pre.5+<commit-hash>'
# If there isn't a release yet (no tag), then we count the commits since the previous
#   release-branch (say 38 commits since release-v1.1 branch point) and
#   return 'v1.2.0-pre.38+<commit-hash>'. We need to count from the previous branch-point
#   since 'master' is using the same naming scheme, and we need to ensure monotonically
#   increasing version numbers. (See next case).
# If a commit is not on a release-branch, find the newest release-branch (say release-v1.5),
#   and count the commits since it (say 22).
#   Return v1.6.0-pre.22+<commit-hash> if we are on master/main or don't know the branch name.
#   Return v1.6.0-pre.22+<branch-name>.<commit-hash> if we know the name.
# Note that "v1.6.0-pre." is also used on a release-v1.6 branch until the release has
#   happened. Care must be taken to ensure that the version numbers increase correctly.
# If there isn't any release-branch, then we use the DEFAULT_PRE_VERSION parameter as prefix.
