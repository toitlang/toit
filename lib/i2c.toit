/**
I2C is a serial communication bus able to address multiple devices along the same 2-wire bus.

To set up an I2C bus:
```
import gpio
import i2c

main:
  bus := i2c.Bus
    --sda=gpio.Pin 21
    --scl=gpio.Pin 22
```

An I2C bus can be associated with a number of devices. Each device must have a unique I2C address. The address can be found in the datasheet for the selected peripheral - it's a 7-bit integer.

In case of the Bosch [BME280 sensor](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/e/7/3/b/1/BME280_Datasheet.pdf), the address is `0x76`:

```
  device := bus.device 0x76
```
