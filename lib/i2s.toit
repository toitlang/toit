/**
I2S Serial communication Bus.

An I2S bus can be either in master or slave mode. In master mode, the bus
  generates the clock and word-select signals. In slave mode, the bus uses
  these signals as input.

Optionally, the peripheral can also generate the master clock (independently
  whether it is the master or not), which may be used for synchronization.
  The master clock is running at a multiple of the sample rate.

# ESP32 and ESP32S2
The ESP32 has two I2S peripherals, each of which can be configured in simplex (one way)
  or duplex (two way) mode. Only pins 0, 1, and 3 can be used as output for
  the master clock. The ESP32 does not support the master clock as input.

The ESP32S2 has one I2S peripheral. Only pins 18, 19, and 20 can be used as
  output for the master clock. The ESP32 does not support the master clock as input.

The channels on the peripheral are not independent. It's not possible to have two
  simplex channels on the same peripheral.

# Other ESP32 variants
The ESP32C3, and ESP32C6 have one I2S peripheral. There are no restrictions on
  which pins can be used for the master clock. The master clock can be used as
  input or output.

The ESP32S3 has two I2S peripherals. Only pins 18, 19, and 20 can be used as output
  for the master clock. Any pin can be used as master clock input.

The channels on the peripheral are independent. It's possible to have two simplex
  channels on the same peripheral. However, while the two channels have independent
  master clocks, only one master clock can be routed to a pin.

// written repeatedly to the I2S channel.

  /**
  Configures the channel.

  A channel can only be configured when it is not running ($start).

  The $sample-rate is the rate at which samples are written.
  The $bits-per-sample is the width of each sample. It can be either 8, 16, 24, or 32.
    For 8 and 24 bits see the note on the ESP32 below.

  The $mclk-multiplier is the multiplier of the $sample-rate to be used for the
    master clock. It should be one of the 128, 256, 384, 512, 576, 768, 1024,
    or 1152. If none is given, it defaults to 384 for 24 bits per sample and
    256 otherwise. If the bits-per-sample is 24 bits, then the multiplier must
    be a multiple of 3.
  The $mclk-multiplier is mostly revelant if a mclk pin was provided, but can
    also be used to allow slower sample-rates: a higher multiplier allows for
    a slower frequency.
  If the $mclk-external-frequency is set to a value and a mclk pin was provided, then
    the master clock is read from the mclk pin. This is only supported on some ESP32
    variants. The $mclk-external-frequency value must be higher than the clock
    frequency (sample-rate * bits-per-sample * 2).

  The $slots-in must be one of $SLOTS-STEREO-BOTH, $SLOTS-MONO-LEFT,
    $SLOTS-MONO-RIGHT.
  The $slots-out must be one of $SLOTS-STEREO-BOTH, $SLOTS-STEREO-LEFT
    (data is stereo, but only emit the left channel),
    $SLOTS-STEREO-RIGHT, $SLOTS-MONO-BOTH (data is mono, and should be sent to
    left and right), $SLOTS-MONO-LEFT, or $SLOTS-MONO-RIGHT.

  The $format must be one of $FORMAT-MSB, $FORMAT-PHILIPS, $FORMAT-PCM-SHORT.
