class Object:
  /**
  Whether this object is equal to the $other.

  By default, $identical is used for equality.

  # Inheritance
  Classes overwrite this operator to get an equality specific to their needs.
    Equality operators often compare the type and field contents. For example:
  ```
  class Pin:
    number/int

    constructor .number:

    operator == other:
      if other is not Pin: return false
      return number == other.number
  ```
  A class doesn't have to follow the above format, but it must keep the
    operator in sync with any `hash_code` method. That is, if a class
    has a `hash_code` member, then the equality and `hash_code`
    must agree. If two instances are equal (`a == b`), then their hash
    codes must also be equal (`a.hash_code == b.hash_code`).

/**
A lambda, or closure.

Use this as a type for Lambdas (`:: ...`).

Lambdas are also known as closures in other languages.

Lambdas are executable pieces of code that can be passed around in a
  program and called for execution. A lambda can reference globals,
  fields, and variables.  Local variables can be captured.

# Aliases
- Closure

# Advanced
Lambdas and blocks both represent some code that can be called at a later point. This is
  why they look syntactically similar. However, contrary to blocks, lambdas can survive the
  function that created it. They can be returned, or stored in fields and globals.

When a lambda is called, the function that created it might not be alive anymore. As such,
  lambdas can not use non-local returns.
