// Implementation of Monitor, see

// special, in that if you use the 'monitor' keyword instead of the 'class'
// method, then your class inherits from this class, and all public methods are
// wrapped in a locked: call. Since the lock is not reentrant this means
// there will be a deadlock if you call a public method from a different public
// method.
