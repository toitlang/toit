/**
The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required

For example, the directory to be deleted
  is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.
  Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between
  FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE:
  - Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call.
  - Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g.,
      when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client
      should restart a read-modify-write sequence).
  - Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until the
      system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an "rmdir" fails
      because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION should be
      returned since the client should not retry unless the files are
      deleted from the directory.

/**
The operation was attempted past the valid range.
E.g., seeking or reading

  that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
  system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an offset that
  is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate OUT_OF_RANGE if
  asked to read from an offset past the current file size. There is a fair
  bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and OUT_OF_RANGE. We recommend
  using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific error) when it applies so that
  callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an
  OUT_OF_RANGE error to detect when they are done.
