/**
Support for byte-order aware manipulation of byte arrays.

The little-endian byte order (generally used by all modern CPUs) stores the
  least-significant byte at the lowest address. Use $LITTLE-ENDIAN (a
  singleton instance of $LittleEndian) to manipulate byte arrays in this order.

The big-endian byte order stores the most-significant byte at the lowest
  address. It is frequently used in networking. Use $BIG-ENDIAN (a
  singleton instance of $BigEndian) to manipulate byte arrays in this order.
