Support for the ESP32 pulse counter (PCNT).

Each unit has two channels that can be configured independently. They share the
  same counter.

The ESP32 has 8 units.
The ESP32C3 has no pulse counter.
The ESP32C6 has 4 units.
The ESP32S2 has 4 units.
The ESP32S3 has 4 units.

```

  unit := pulse-counter.Unit pin

  Constructs a pulse-counter unit.

  The $low and $high values are limits. When the counter reaches this limit, the value

  If a $glitch-filter-ns is given, then all pulses shorter than $glitch-filter-ns nanoseconds are
    ignored.

  # Advanced
  The $glitch-filter-ns are converted to APB clock cycles. Usually the APB clock runs at 80MHz,
    which means that the shortest $glitch-filter-ns that makes sense is 1/80MHz = 12.5ns (-> 13).

  The glitch filter is limited to 10 bits, and the highest value is thus 1023 ticks, or 12_787ns
    (12.5 * 1023 = 12_787.5).
