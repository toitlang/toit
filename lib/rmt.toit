A collection of signals to be transmitted or received with the RMT controller.

An RMT signal consists of a level (low or high) and a period (the number of

The period is specified in number of ticks, so the actual time the level is
  sustained is determined by the RMT controller configuration.

At the lower level, a signal consists of 16 bits: 15 bits for the period and 1
