# Examples

A fading LED:
```
import gpio
import gpio.pwm

main:
  led := gpio.Pin 5
  // Create a PWM square wave generator with frequency 400Hz.
  generator := pwm.Pwm --frequency=400

  // Use it to drive the LED pin.
  // By default the duty factor is 0.
  channel := generator.start led

  duty_percent := 0
  step := 1
  while true:
    // Update the duty factor.
    channel.set_duty_factor duty_percent/100.0
    duty_percent += step
    if duty_percent == 0 or duty_percent == 100:
      step = -step
    sleep --ms=10
```

Driving a servo:
```
import gpio
import gpio.pwm

main:
  servo := gpio.Pin 14
  // Most servos need a 50Hz frequency. However, some models go up to
  // 400Hz. Consult the documentation for your servo.

  // Create a PWM square-wave generator with frequency 50.
  generator := pwm.Pwm --frequency=50

  // Generally, the acceptable duty-factor range of servos is 0.025 to 0.125.
  // Therefore start the pin with 0.075.
  channel := generator.start servo --duty_factor=0.075
  sleep --ms=1000

  // Max angle.
  print "max"
  channel.set_duty_factor 0.125
  sleep --ms=1500

  // Min angle.
  print "min"
  channel.set_duty_factor 0.025
  sleep --ms=1500
```

/**
A Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) instance, for managing multiple $PwmChannel.

  /**
  Constructs the PWM generator with the given $frequency and $max-frequency.

  The resolution of the PWM is dependent on the max frequency. The higher it is
    the less resolution there is.

  The frequency of the PWM must lie within a certain factor of the max frequency.
    For example, given a $max-frequency of 10KHz, the lowest frequency that is
    accepted is 20Hz.

  The $max-frequency is limited to 40MHz.
  The lowest acceptable frequency is 1Hz.

  # Advanced
  On the ESP32, the duty resolution is computed as follows:
  ```
  uint32 bits = msb(max_frequency << 1);
  uint32 resolution_bits = kMaxFrequencyBits - bits;
  duty_resolution = (ledc_timer_bit_t)resolution_bits,
  ```
  This provides the highest duty resolution for the given max frequency.

  See https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/ledc.html#supported-range-of-frequency-and-duty-resolutions
    for the limitations of the frequency with respect to the duty resolution.
