/**
Analog-to-Digital Conversion.

This library provides ways to read analogue voltage values from GPIO pins that
  support it.

On the ESP32, there are two ADCs. ADC1 (pins 32-39) should be preferred as
  ADC2 (pins 0, 2, 4, 12-15, 25-27) has lots of restrictions. It can't be
  used when WiFi is active, and some of the pins are
  strapping pins). By default, ADC2 is disabled, and users need to pass in a flag to
  allow its use.

# Examples
```
import gpio
import gpio.adc show Adc

main:
  adc := Adc (gpio.Pin 34)
  print adc.get
  adc.close
```

  /**
  Initializes an Adc unit for the $pin.

  Use $max-voltage to indicate max voltage expected to measure. This helps to
    tune the attenuation of the underlying ADC unit. If no $max-voltage is
    provided, the ADC uses the maximum voltage range of the pin.

  If $allow-restricted is provided, allows pins that are restricted.
