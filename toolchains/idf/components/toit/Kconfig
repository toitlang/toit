            An optional assets file to add to the entry point. The file is assumed to be named with an extension of json

            If selected the font rendering primitives will be included in the
            Toit binary.  If this is selected you would normally want to also
            select either TOIT_BYTE_DISPLAY or TOIT_BIT_DISPLAY, otherwise you
            can only query font metrics, but not actually render characters.

            If selected, embedded platforms will include code for run-length
            encoding.  It is available with `import zlib show
            RunLengthZlibEncoder`.

            This option takes about 1600 bytes of flash on ESP32 Xtensa.

    config TOIT_FULL_ZLIB
        bool "Include primitives for zlib compression/decompression in native code"
        default "n"
        help
            If selected, embedded platforms will include code for compressing
            and decompressing.  It is based on the MiniZ library.  It is
            available with `import zlib show Encoder Decoder`.

            Note that decompressing needs a contiguous
            32k buffer, so for systems without SPIRAM this is unlikely to work
            well.

            This option takes about 16k of flash on ESP32 Xtensa.

            As an alternative there is a pure Toit implementation of zlib
            decompression in the Toit standard library.  Use
            `import zlib show BufferingInflater CopyingInflater` to get
            access to this implementation.  The pure Toit version is slower,
            but always available, and does not suffer from fragmentation
            issues when allocating buffer space.

            There are also simple Toit implementations of zlib compression.
            These do not deliver large compression, but generate data streams
            compatible with zlib compression, eg for browsers that insist on
            getting zlib compressed data.

            Use `import zlib show UncompressedZlibEncoder` to
            get access to the uncompressed zlib-compatible encoder.

            Use `import zlib show RunLengthZlibEncoder` to
            get access to a zlib-compatible encoder that does only run-length
            encoding. This requires the TOIT_ZLIB_RLE option to be selected.

    config TOIT_REPORT_UART_DATA_LOSS
        bool "Report when UART data is lost"
        default "y"
        help
            If selected, the UART driver will report when data is lost due to
            the UART buffer being full.

            This slows down the UART driver slightly when it is already under
            pressure and has no purpose if the device's serial part is not
            monitored.

                If selected, the interpreter will be placed in IRAM. This will

                If selected, the interpreter helper functions will be placed in
