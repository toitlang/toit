<purpose>
Create `.continue-here.md` handoff file to preserve complete work state across sessions. Enables seamless resumption with full context restoration.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.
</required_reading>

<process>

<step name="detect">
Find current phase directory from most recently modified files:

```bash
# Find most recent phase directory with work
ls -lt .planning/phases/*/PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | head -1 | grep -oP 'phases/\K[^/]+'
```

If no active phase detected, ask user which phase they're pausing work on.
</step>

<step name="gather">
**Collect complete state for handoff:**

1. **Current position**: Which phase, which plan, which task
2. **Work completed**: What got done this session
3. **Work remaining**: What's left in current plan/phase
4. **Decisions made**: Key decisions and rationale
5. **Blockers/issues**: Anything stuck
6. **Mental context**: The approach, next steps, "vibe"
7. **Files modified**: What's changed but not committed

Ask user for clarifications if needed via conversational questions.
</step>

<step name="write">
**Write handoff to `.planning/phases/XX-name/.continue-here.md`:**

Be specific enough for a fresh Claude to understand immediately.

Use `current-timestamp` for last_updated field. You can use init todos (which provides timestamps) or call directly:
```bash
timestamp=$(node "/home/flo/work/opentoit-ec618/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" current-timestamp full --raw)
```
</step>

<step name="commit">
```bash
node "/home/flo/work/opentoit-ec618/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "wip: [phase-name] paused at task [X]/[Y]" --files .planning/phases/*/.continue-here.md
```
</step>
