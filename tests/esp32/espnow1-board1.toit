/**
Tests the espnow functionality.

This test must be run without WiFi. (In theory it's
  possible to run with WiFi, but then the channel needs to be
  set to the same channel as the WiFi network.)

On Jaguar use:
  `jag container install -D jag.disabled -D jag.timeout=1m espnow espnow1_board1.toit`

Run `espnow1_board1.toit` on board1.
Once that one is running, run `espnow1_board2.toit` on board2.
