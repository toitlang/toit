# ESP32 tests

This directory contains tests for ESP functionality.

The tests are not run automatically, and might require a specific hardware setup.
Ideally they should eventually run automatically, but for now they should still
be useful for making sure that all of the functionality has been run at least
once. It should make refactoring easier too.
