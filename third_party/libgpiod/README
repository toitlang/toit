libgpiod
========

  libgpiod - C library and tools for interacting with the linux GPIO
             character device (gpiod stands for GPIO device)

Since linux 4.8 the GPIO sysfs interface is deprecated. User space should use
the character device instead. This library encapsulates the ioctl calls and
data structures behind a straightforward API.

RATIONALE
---------

The new character device interface guarantees all allocated resources are
freed after closing the device file descriptor and adds several new features
that are not present in the obsolete sysfs interface (like event polling,
setting/reading multiple values at once or open-source and open-drain GPIOs).

Unfortunately interacting with the linux device file can no longer be done
using only standard command-line tools. This is the reason for creating a
library encapsulating the cumbersome, ioctl-based kernel-userspace interaction
in a set of convenient functions and opaque data structures.

Additionally this project contains a set of command-line tools that should
allow an easy conversion of user scripts to using the character device.

BUILDING
--------

This is a pretty standard autotools project. The core C library does not have
any external dependencies other than the standard C library with GNU extensions.

The command-line tools optionally depend on libedit for the interactive feature.

To build the project (including command-line utilities) run:

    ./autogen.sh --enable-tools=yes --prefix=<install path>
    make
    make install

The autogen script will execute ./configure and pass all the command-line
arguments to it.

If building from release tarballs, the configure script is already provided and
there's no need to invoke autogen.sh.

For all configure features, see: ./configure --help.

TOOLS
-----

There are currently six command-line tools available:

* gpiodetect - list all gpiochips present on the system, their names, labels
               and number of GPIO lines

* gpioinfo   - list lines, their gpiochip, offset, name, and direction, and
               if in use then the consumer name and any other configured
               attributes, such as active state, bias, drive, edge detection
               and debounce period

* gpioget    - read values of specified GPIO lines

* gpioset    - set values of specified GPIO lines, holding the lines until the
               process is killed or otherwise exits

* gpiomon    - wait for edge events on GPIO lines, specify which edges to watch
               for, how many events to process before exiting, or if the events
               should be reported to the console

* gpionotify - wait for changed to the info for GPIO lines, specify which
               changes to watch for, how many events to process before exiting,
               or if the events should be reported to the console

Examples:

    (using a Raspberry Pi 4B)

    # Detect the available gpiochips.
    $ gpiodetect
    gpiochip0 [pinctrl-bcm2711] (58 lines)
    gpiochip1 [raspberrypi-exp-gpio] (8 lines)

    # Read the info for all the lines on a gpiochip.
    $ gpioinfo -c 1
    gpiochip1 - 8 lines:
     line   0: "BT_ON"          output
     line   1: "WL_ON"          output
     line   2: "PWR_LED_OFF"    output active-low consumer="led1"

BINDINGS
--------

High-level, object-oriented bindings for C++, python3 and Rust are provided.
They can be enabled by passing --enable-bindings-cxx, --enable-bindings-python
and --enable-bindings-rust arguments respectively to configure.

C++ bindings require C++11 support and autoconf-archive collection if building
from git.

Python bindings require python3 support and libpython development files. Care
must be taken when cross-compiling python bindings: users usually must specify
the PYTHON_CPPFLAGS and PYTHON_LIBS variables in order to point the build
system to the correct locations. During native builds, the configure script
can auto-detect the location of the development files.

Rust bindings require cargo support. When building the Rust bindings along the
C library using make, they will be automatically configured to build against the
build results of the C library.

TESTING
-------

A comprehensive testing framework is included with the library and can be
used to test both the core library code as well as the kernel-to-user-space
interface.

The minimum kernel version required to run the tests can be checked in the
tests/gpiod-test.c source file (it's subject to change if new features are
added to the kernel). The tests work together with the gpio-sim kernel module
which must either be built-in or available for loading using kmod. A helper
library - libgpiosim - is included to enable straightforward interaction with
the module.

To build the testing executable add the '--enable-tests' option when running
the configure script. If enabled, the tests will be installed next to
gpio-tools.

As opposed to standard autotools projects, libgpiod doesn't execute any tests
when invoking 'make check'. Instead the user must run them manually with
superuser privileges.

The testing framework uses the GLib unit testing library so development package
for GLib must be installed.

The gpio-tools programs can be tested separately using the gpio-tools-test.bash
script. It requires shunit2[1] to run and assumes that the tested executables are
in the same directory as the script.

C++, Rust and Python bindings also include their own test-suites. All three
reuse the libgpiosim library to avoid code duplication when interacting with
gpio-sim.

Python test-suite uses the standard unittest package. C++ tests use an external
testing framework - Catch2 - which must be installed in the system. Rust
bindings use the standard tests module layout and the #[test] attribute.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

All API symbols exposed by the core C API and C++ bindings are documented with
doxygen markup blocks. Doxygen documentation can be generated by executing
'make doc' given that the doxygen executable is available in the system.

Python bindings contain help strings that can be accessed with the help
builtin.

Rust bindings use rustdoc.

Man pages for command-line programs are generated automatically if gpio-tools
were selected and help2man is available in the system.

CONTRIBUTING
------------

Contributions are welcome - please send questions, patches and bug reports
to the linux-gpio mailing list[2] by e-mailing to linux-gpio@vger.kernel.org
(add the [libgpiod] prefix to the e-mail subject line).
Note that the mailing list quietly drops HTML formatted e-mail, so be sure
to send plain text[3].

Code submissions should stick to the linux kernel coding style[4] and
follow the kernel patch submission process[5] as applied to the libgpiod
source tree.

The mailing list archive[6] contains all the historical mails to the list,
and is the place to check to ensure your e-mail has been received.
Search for "libgpiod" to filter the list down to relevant messages.
Those also provide examples of the expected formatting.
Allow some time for your e-mail to propagate to the list before retrying,
particularly if there are no e-mails in the list more recent than yours.
