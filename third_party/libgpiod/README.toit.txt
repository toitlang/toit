Description:
 C library and tools for interacting with the linux GPIO
character device

We have added a CMakeLists.txt (inspired by
https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAFKLa4+CB5Of1T-fjvtxtzBoeB8xYVENsAZCShRPmBmkGe6ZKQ@mail.gmail.com/T/).

We have removed directories (like 'tools', 'tests', ...) that aren't used.
